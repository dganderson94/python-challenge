# python-challenge

These two Python scripts demonstrate my ability to access CSV files and perform basis analyses on them using Python.

# PyBank

This script examines a CSV file containing budget data and displays the length of the analysis in months, the total profit, the average change in profit/losses, and the greatests increase and decrease in profit.

# PyPoll

This script counts votes stored in a CSV file for an election and displays the total number of votes, the names of each candidate, how many votes each candidate received in both flat numerical form and as a percentage of the total votes, and, of course, the winner of the election.
